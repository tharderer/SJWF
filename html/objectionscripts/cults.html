				<p>Read: <b>Exodus 3:14</b></p>
				<p><i><b>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</b></i> </p>
	
				<p>You:  The Jewish people wanted to stone Jesus because they knew he was referring to himself as God when he called himself, “I AM!” He was using the divine name of God found in Exodus 3:14.</p>
	
				<p>Read: <b>John 5:18</b></p>
				<p><i><b> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</b></i></p>

				<p>Read: <b>Matthew 9 2-6</b></p> 
	
				<p><i><b>2. And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</b></i></p>
	
				<p><i><b>3. And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.</b></i></p>
	
				<p><i><b>4. And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</b></i></p>
	
				<p><i><b>5. For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?</b></i></p>
	
				<p><i><b>6. But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</b></i></p>
	
				<p>Read: <b>John 9:38</b></p>
