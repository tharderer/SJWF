			<h1>A Christian hurt me.</h1>
			<p>You:	I'm so sorry that happened. Would you accept my apology, for those who did that to you?</p>
			<p>You: (If appropriate:) Have you ever tried to love somebody and made a mess out of it? You had good intentions, but everything went wrong. Do you think there was a possibility in your friend's desire for you to know Jesus that she just went about it the wrong way? </p>
			<p>You: Jesus would not approve of rude behavior either. By the way, what is your understanding of who Jesus is?</p>
