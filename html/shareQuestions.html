				<h1>The Five Share Questions</h1>
				<h3>1. Do you have any kind of spiritual beliefs?</h3>
				<h3>2. To you, who is Jesus?</h3>
				<h3>3. Do you think there is a heaven or a hell?</h3>
				<h3>4. If you died tonight, where would you go?</h3>
				<h3>5. By the way, if what you were believing is not true, would you want to know?</h3>
